# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
The software I wrote displays a list of schools in Nigeria and their JAMB cutoff mark.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
My purpose is to help Nigerian Students in their university application by providing them with the list of cutoff marks and to help them know what school will accept their score

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
